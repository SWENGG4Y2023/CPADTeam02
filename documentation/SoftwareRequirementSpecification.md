      This system is aimed to give better out look to the user interfaces and to provide wellness information to the Fitbit Members. This project is a mobile and a web application where users can access the application while doing any physical activity. The main purpose of this system is to make users know their physical activity benefits and encourage them to work out more. This application can help users to track their fitness activities like how much calories they have burned, steps they have taken, distance they have walked, heart rate tracking etc. This application can help users who have joined gym recently in making their AI enabled workout schedule and help them in defining their fitness goal. It can also help in developing a diet and nutrition chart based on the current fitness condition of the user. The user can either be a consumer of fitness details or fitness consultant, a user can be fitness consultant only when its certification is verified. Once the user is verified as consultant, they can provide consultations to other users either for free or for a charge depending upon them and can share information with them. The consultation will be of either 30 minutes or 1 hour duration and users can rate the consultants based upon their liking.
